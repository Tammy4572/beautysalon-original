		<p>Winter hair<br />
		<br />
		•Wash your hair less often so as to strip less of the hair’s natural 
		oil. <br />
		•Use a dry shampoo if you need to wash. One way to have a dry shampoo is 
		to sprinkle some baby powder onto your hair and comb it off. <br />
		•Deep condition once a week. Try massaging your scalp with 4 tablespoons 
		of honey and cover with a plastic bag for 15 minutes or more then rinse 
		off totally with hot water. <br />
		Static <br />
		<br />
		•A leave-on conditioner or hair mousse can get rid of static. Hair 
		static is caused by a lack of hair moisture. <br />
		•Brush with natural and not plastic bristles. <br />
		Hair loss<br />
		<br />
		•Try drinking this - blend bananas with honey, yoghurt and low-fat milk. 
		A drink rich in biotin can help keep your crowning glory firmly rooted.
		<br />
		•Take dietary supplements such as Vitamin B6, zinc and saw palmetto. 
		Supplements are useful when you can’t get enough from natural food 
		sources. <br />
		•Invert your head while you shampoo and massage your scalp. This helps 
		promote blood circulation to the head. <br />
		•Eliminate stress or else it can be disastrous to your precious hair!
		<br />
		•Get enough sleep. <br />
		•To stimulate scalp circulation, massage the scalp with rosemary 
		(Rosmarinus officinalis) essential oil or rinse hair with tea made from 
		sage (Salvia officinalis)•In 76 Ways to Use Noni Fruit Juice (Direct 
		Source, 2001) Ms. Isabelle Navarre-Brown suggests the noni rash 
		treatment by applying noni fruit juice directly onto the scalp using a 
		plaster cloth.<br />
		Another alternative is to apply noni extract directly onto the scalp, 
		massage and leave to dry.<br />
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dandruff<br />
		<br />
		•Dandruff arises from an oily, not dry scalp. Use a special-formaulated 
		shampoo to help control the flaking. <br />
		•An anti-dandruff shampoo should contain tea tree oil, salicylic acid, 
		sulfur and zinc pyrithione. Use on alternate days. <br />
		•Massage your scalp with some table salt to remove dandruff then 
		shampoo. <br />
		•Avoid taking foods with preservatives or additives. <br />
		•After washing your hair, massage your scalp with half a cup of apple 
		cidar vinegar. Leave it there, don’t rinse off. Do this for a week.
		<br />
		•You could try this leave-on after shampooing : boil 1 cup of water with 
		2 tablespoons of dried thyme for 5 minutes and leave to cool. Strain 
		then massage onto hair and scalp. Don’t rinse off. <br />
		•In 76 Ways to Use Noni Fruit Juice (Direct Source, 2001) Ms. Isabelle 
		Navarre-Brown recommends the noni scalp treatment by applying noni fruit 
		juice directly onto the affected scalp, massage for a couple of minutes, 
		leave to dry. Noni can be left overnight or a few hours or it can be 
		rinsed off after about 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse off the noni juice and 
		wash hair. Noni has essential fatty acids that help counteract hair and 
		scalp trauma. It contains antioxidants that fight against free radical 
		damage to the hair and scalp and may end chronic hair problems. <br />
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head lice<br />
		<br />
		•Lice are very tiny wingless blood-sucking insects. They spread quickly 
		when there is personal contact or when items such as combs, brushes, 
		towels, pillows, clothings and hats are shared. It is best that you 
		don’t share such items with someone else. Lice infestion can also occur 
		at beards, eyelashes and eyebrows. <br />
		•Ways to get rid of head lice and nits (eggs) include : applying 
		anti-lice medication (lotion, cream or shampoo), using essential oils 
		such as herbs thyme and rosemary, manual removal and getting a hair cut.
		<br />
		•Wash combs, brushes, hats, beddings, stuffed toys, school bags, coats 
		with hoods, clothings and etc… in hot water. <br />
		•Vaccum thoroughly floors, furniture, carpets, car seats and their head 
		rests. Discard the vaccum bag immediately. <br />
		•Hair Clean 1-2-3 Lice Remover (Quantum) - A very highly recommended and 
		effective non-toxic formula made from essential plant oils.</p>
