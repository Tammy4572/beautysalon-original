<p>2.&nbsp; Hair Styles by Tom Salon - Products<br>
Description:&nbsp; Hair Styles by Tom stocks a full line of the most popular 
hair and beauty products.&nbsp; From Allure to Vidal Sasson products you will 
find the largest selection, the most expert staff and the lowest prices in the 
low country.<br>
<br>
Our products are about choice and attitude. Select products and wear them as 
your mood shifts from day to day, outfit to outfit, event to event, or season to 
season. <br>
<br>
Rather than feeling that you have to pile wax on top of crème on top of spray, 
as editorial stylists do out of necessity, get to know each product individually 
first. Though you’ll naturally gravitate to several favorites, be adventurous.
<br>
<br>
Some people go for gritty, matte textures and choose Surf Spray or Sumotech. 
Others prefer more polished finishes and reach for Brilliantine, Sumowax or 
Gloss. Minimalists and naturalists swear by Leave In Conditioner, Prep or Tonic, 
or a hint of Grooming Creme. Leading ladies make it big with Thickening Spray, 
Does It All or Classic Hairspray. The naturally curly spring for Curl Conscious 
products.<br>
<br>
Whatever you do, seek stylists’ advice (if you haven’t already). Besides 
recommending the right shampoo and conditioner, they cut hair with products in 
mind, use them while cutting, and can teach you when and how to use them. A 
versatile cut can be worn several ways and products are key to changing it.</p>
<p>Now Offering Treatment. 4 distinct products for for different types of hair 
issues. </p>
<p>Damage Therapy, for chemically treated hair. <br>

hair while you are away from our salon.&nbsp; If you ever have any hair or 
beauty questions please contact any of our beauty professionals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter hair<br>
<br>
•Wash your hair less often so as to strip less of the hair’s natural oil. <br>
•Use a dry shampoo if you need to wash. One way to have a dry shampoo is to 
sprinkle some baby powder onto your hair and comb it off. <br>
•Deep condition once a week. Try massaging your scalp with 4 tablespoons of 
honey and cover with a plastic bag for 15 minutes or more then rinse off totally 
with hot water. <br>
Static <br>
<br>
•A leave-on conditioner or hair mousse can get rid of static. Hair static is 
caused by a lack of hair moisture. <br>
•Brush with natural and not plastic bristles. <br>
Hair loss<br>
<br>
•Try drinking this - blend bananas with honey, yoghurt and low-fat milk. A drink 
rich in biotin can help keep your crowning glory firmly rooted. <br>
•Take dietary supplements such as Vitamin B6, zinc and saw palmetto. Supplements 
are useful when you can’t get enough from natural food sources. <br>
•Invert your head while you shampoo and massage your scalp. This helps promote 
blood circulation to the head. <br>
•Eliminate stress or else it can be disastrous to your precious hair! <br>
•Get enough sleep. <br>
•To stimulate scalp circulation, massage the scalp with rosemary (Rosmarinus 
officinalis) essential oil or rinse hair with tea made from sage (Salvia 
officinalis)•In 76 Ways to Use Noni Fruit Juice (Direct Source, 2001) Ms. 
Isabelle Navarre-Brown suggests the noni rash treatment by applying noni fruit 
juice directly onto the scalp using a plaster cloth.<br>
Another alternative is to apply noni extract directly onto the scalp, massage 
and leave to dry.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dandruff<br>
<br>
•Dandruff arises from an oily, not dry scalp. Use a special-formaulated shampoo 
to help control the flaking. <br>
•An anti-dandruff shampoo should contain tea tree oil, salicylic acid, sulfur 
and zinc pyrithione. Use on alternate days. <br>
•Massage your scalp with some table salt to remove dandruff then shampoo. <br>
•Avoid taking foods with preservatives or additives. <br>
•After washing your hair, massage your scalp with half a cup of apple cidar 
vinegar. Leave it there, don’t rinse off. Do this for a week. <br>
•You could try this leave-on after shampooing : boil 1 cup of water with 2 
tablespoons of dried thyme for 5 minutes and leave to cool. Strain then massage 
onto hair and scalp. Don’t rinse off. <br>
•In 76 Ways to Use Noni Fruit Juice (Direct Source, 2001) Ms. Isabelle 
Navarre-Brown recommends the noni scalp treatment by applying noni fruit juice 
directly onto the affected scalp, massage for a couple of minutes, leave to dry. 
Noni can be left overnight or a few hours or it can be rinsed off after about 20 
to 30 minutes. Rinse off the noni juice and wash hair. Noni has essential fatty 
acids that help counteract hair and scalp trauma. It contains antioxidants that 
fight against free radical damage to the hair and scalp and may end chronic hair 
problems. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head lice<br>
<br>
•Lice are very tiny wingless blood-sucking insects. They spread quickly when 
there is personal contact or when items such as combs, brushes, towels, pillows, 
clothings and hats are shared. It is best that you don’t share such items with 
someone else. Lice infestion can also occur at beards, eyelashes and eyebrows.
<br>
•Ways to get rid of head lice and nits (eggs) include : applying anti-lice 
medication (lotion, cream or shampoo), using essential oils such as herbs thyme 
and rosemary, manual removal and getting a hair cut. <br>
•Wash combs, brushes, hats, beddings, stuffed toys, school bags, coats with 
hoods, clothings and etc… in hot water. <br>
•Vaccum thoroughly floors, furniture, carpets, car seats and their head rests. 
Discard the vaccum bag immediately. <br>

<p>8.&nbsp; Hair Styles by Tom Salon - Hair Maintenance<br>
Description.&nbsp; While away from Hair Styles by Tom you need to follow these 
beauty tips in order to keep your hair at it's peak condition.&nbsp; Contact one 
of our beauty consultants if you have any questions.</p>
<p>How to achieve and maintain a healthy head of beautiful hair. <br>
<br>
Three main things are needed for a good-looking head of hair - haute hair - good 
health, the right attention to cleanliness, and caution when using cosmetic 
treatments. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adequate Diet <br>
<br>
Hair growth depends on an adequate diet. A widespread diet problem which causes 
loss of hair is iron deficiency Anaemia. The cause is too little iron in blood, 
brought on by a diet containing too little meat, eggs, cereals or peas and 
beans. Fresh fruits and vegetables are also needed to provide vitamin C, which 
enables the body to absorb iron. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cutting the hair <br>
<br>
Although cutting the hair is not essential to its well-being, it is easier to 
keep the scalp clean if the hair is kept reasonably short. Regular cutting does 
not make the hair grow strong or faster. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How hair can be damaged <br>
<br>
Although scalp hair is hardy, and can withstand a lot of abuse, it can be 
damaged by too much or inexpertly applied perming, dyeing - Blonde to Brunette, 
bleaching and massage. The amount of beautying the hair can take varies from 
person to person. Occasionally the scalp is allergic to the dye and becomes 
inflamed and swollen. To prevent this occuring, the dye should be tested by 
applying it to a small area on the arm. If a patch of inflammation has 
developed, the dye must not be used on the hair. <br>
<br>
Most people who bleach their hair do so with hydrogen peroxide. If the peroxide 
is repeatedly applied, it may make the hair brittle. Hair SOS If this happens 
the hair may turn rough, develop split ends, or become thinned or shortened. </p>

health to ensure customers maintain healthy nails.<br>

For your nails to be healthy your diet should include a lot of fruits and raw 
vegetables so that they get the required vitamins, minerals and enzymes. Eat 
food that is rich in silicon like broccoli, fish and onions. Eat foods rich in 
biotins like whole grains. Drink plenty of water and other fruit juices. Food 
rich in zinc and vitamin B will strengthen your nails. Fresh carrot juice rich 
in calcium and phosphorous is perfect for strengthening nails. In addition 
remember the following things: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Lack of vitamin A and calcium in your body causes dryness and 
	brittleness. </li>
	<li>Lack of protein, folic acid and vitamin C causes hangnails. </li>
	<li>White bands across the nails are a result of protein deficiency. </li>
	<li>A lack of sufficient hydrochloric acid can cause splitting nails. </li>
	<li>Lack of vitamin B12 can lead to dryness, very rounded and curved ends 
	and darkening of nails. </li>
	<li>Insufficient zinc can cause development of white spots on the nails.
	</li>
	<li>Cuts and cracks in the nails may indicate a need for more liquids. </li>

	essential fatty acids. </li>
